# 🍽️ Restaurant Review Analysis

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** of restaurant reviews using machine learning algorithms: **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Text preprocessing** and feature extraction using **CountVectorizer**
- Implementation of **Naive Bayes** and **SVM** classifiers
- **Model comparison** based on accuracy
- **ML pipeline** created using `scikit-learn` for streamlined processing
- **SVM pipeline** saved using `joblib`
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive web interface

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 🔹 Naive Bayes Classifier
A probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes’ Theorem**. It calculates the probability of a review being positive or negative based on word occurrence.

Use Case: Sentiment analysis

---

### 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A supervised algorithm that finds the **optimal hyperplane** separating classes in an N-dimensional space.  

Use Cases: Text classification, Face detection

**SVM performed better in this project in terms of accuracy.**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, Numpy**
- **CountVectorizer**
- **Joblib**
- **Streamlit**

---

## 📊 Results
The **SVM pipeline achieved higher accuracy** compared to Naive Bayes. The final model was saved and used in a **Streamlit web application** to predict sentiment of new reviews.
